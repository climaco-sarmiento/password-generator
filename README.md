In this app, you can choose several parameters for the random password that will be generated by the app. These parameters include the character length and inclusion of: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. You can also choose to let the app copy the password to the clipboard.
This is a DOM manipulation exercise that I did, folowing along with a tutorial.
